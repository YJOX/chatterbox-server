# chatterbox-server
My chat program in C# programming language using Windows Forms and TCP (unfinished and bad code).

Implemented:
- Authorization
- Registration
- Sending a code to the mail and checking it
- Client-server interaction
- Downloading created chats from the server
- Create a new chat

Not implemented:
- The chats themselves (messaging)
- Several checks are missing in the code

The code is freely distributed, you can use it anywhere and in any way.
